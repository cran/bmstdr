   abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian modeling of large point-referenced space-time data is increasingly becoming feasible in many environmental applications due to the recent advances in both statistical methodology and computation power. Implementation of these methods using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computational techniques, however, requires development of problem-specific and user-written computer code, possibly in a low-level language. This programming requirement is hindering the widespread use of the Bayesian model-based methods among practitioners and, hence there is an urgent need to develop high-level software that can analyze large data sets rich in both space and time. This paper develops the package spTimer for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of stylized environmental space-time monitoring data as a contributed software package in the R language that is fast becoming a very popular statistical computing platform. The package is able to fit, spatially and temporally predict large amounts of space-time data using three recently developed Bayesian models. The user is given control over many options regarding covariance function selection, distance calculation, prior selection and tuning of the implemented MCMC algorithms, although suitable defaults are provided. The package has many other attractive features such as on the fly transformations and an ability to spatially predict temporally aggregated summaries on the original scale, which saves the problem of storage when using MCMC methods for large datasets. A simulation example, with more than a million observations, and a real life data example are used to validate the underlying code and to illustrate the software capabilities.},

abstract={A unidimensional latent trait model for responses scored in two or more ordered categories is developed. This ``Partial Credit'' model is a member of the family of latent trait models which share the property of parameter separability and so permit ``specifically objective'' comparisons of persons and items. The model can be viewed as an extension of Andrich's Rating Scale model to situations in which ordered response alternatives are free to vary in number and structure from item to item. The difference between the parameters in this model and the ``category boundaries'' in Samejima's Graded Response model is demonstrated. An unconditional maximum likelihood procedure for estimating the model parameters is developed.},

abstract={In this article, a two-level regression model is imposed on the ability parameters in an item response theory (IRT) model. The advantage of using latent rather than observed scores as dependent variables of a multilevel model is that it offers the possibility of separating the influence of item difficulty and ability level and modeling response variation and measurement error. Another advantage is that, contrary to observed scores, latent scores are test-independent, which offers the possibility of using results from different tests in one analysis where the parameters of the IRT model and the multilevel model can be concurrently estimated. The two-parameter normal ogive model is used for the IRT measurement model. It will be shown that the parameters of the two-parameter normal ogive model and the multilevel model can be estimated in a Bayesian framework using Gibbs sampling. Examples using simulated and real data are given.}

abstract ={Model checking in item response theory (IRT) is an underdeveloped area. There is no universally accepted tool for checking IRT models. The posterior predictive model-checking method is a popular Bayesian model-checking tool because it has intuitive appeal, is simple to apply, has a strong theoretical basis, and can provide graphical or numerical evidence about model misfit. An important issue with the application of the posterior predictive model-checking method is the choice of a discrepancy measure (which plays a role like that of a test statistic in traditional hypothesis tests). This article examines the performance of a number of discrepancy measures for assessing different aspects of fit of the common IRT models and makes specific recommendations about what measures are most useful in assessing model fit. Graphical summaries of model-checking results are demonstrated to provide useful insights about model fit.},

This paper applies the posterior predictive model checking (PPMC) method (Guttman, 1967; Rubin, 1984), a popular Bayesian model checking tool, to a number of real applications of unidimensional IRT models. The applications demonstrate how to exploit the flexibility of the posterior predictive checks to meet the need of the researcher. This paper also examines practical consequences of misfit, an area often ignored in educational measurement literature while assessing model fit.}

They also allow for different parameterizations of the conditional distribution of the response variables given the latent traits, depending on both the type of link function and constraints imposed on the discriminating and difficulty item parameters. These models may be estimated by maximum likelihood via an Expectation–Maximization algorithm, which is implemented in the MultiLCIRT package. Issues related to model selection are also discussed in detail. In order to illustrate this package, two datasets are analyzed: one concerning binary items and referred to the measurement of ability in mathematics and the other one coming from the administration of ordinal polytomous items for the assessment of anxiety and depression. In the first application, aggregation of items in homogeneous groups is illustrated through a model-based hierarchical clustering procedure which is implemented in the proposed package. In the second application, the steps to select a specific model having the best fit in the class of \{IRT\} models at issue are described. }

abstract = {The US Food and Drug Administration recently announced the final guidelines on the development and validation of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessments in drug labeling and clinical trials. This guidance paper may boost the demand for new PRO survey questionnaires. Henceforth, biostatisticians may encounter psychometric methods more frequently, particularly item response theory (IRT) models to guide the shortening of a PRO assessment instrument. This article aims to provide an introduction on the theory and practical analytic skills in fitting a generalized partial credit model (GPCM) in IRT. GPCM theory is explained first, with special attention to a clearer exposition of the formal mathematics than what is typically available in the psychometric literature. Then, a worked example is presented, using self-reported responses taken from the international personality item pool. The worked example contains step-by-step guides on using the statistical languages r and WinBUGS in fitting the GPCM. Finally, the Fisher information function of the GPCM model is derived and used to evaluate, as an illustrative example, the usefulness of assessment items by their information contents. This article aims to encourage biostatisticians to apply IRT models in the re-analysis of existing data and in future research. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

These include functions for simulating realizations from the posterior distribution, profiling the posterior density or likelihood function, calculation of posterior modes or means, Fisher information functions and observed information, and profile likelihood confidence intervals. Inferences can be based on individual response patterns or sets of response patterns such as sum scores. Functions are included for several common binary and polytomous item response models, but the package can also be used with user-specified models.

abstract ={Many latent traits in the human sciences have a hierarchical structure. This study aimed to develop a new class of higher order item response theory models for hierarchical latent traits that are flexible in accommodating both dichotomous and polytomous items, to estimate both item and person parameters jointly, to allow users to specify customized item response functions, and to go beyond two orders of latent traits and the linear relationship between latent traits. Parameters of the new class of models can be estimated using the Bayesian approach with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Through a series of simulations, the authors demonstrated that the parameters in the new class of models can be well recovered with the computer software WinBUGS, and the joint estimation approach was more efficient than multistaged or consecutive approaches. Two empirical examples of achievement and personality assessments were given to demonstrate applications and implications of the new models.},

In a posterior predictive check, the observed value on a discrepancy variable is positioned in its posterior distribution. In a Bayesian framework, a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure can be used to generate samples of the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest. These draws can also be used to compute the posterior predictive distribution of the discrepancy variable. The procedure is worked out in detail for the three-parameter normal ogive model, but it is also shown that the procedure can be directly generalized to many other IRT models. Type I error rate and the power against some specific model violations are evaluated using a number of simulation studies.

Our approach replaces the linear predictor of the generalized partial credit model with a monotonic polynomial. The model includes the regular generalized partial credit model at the lowest order polynomial. Our approach extends Liang's (A semi-parametric approach to estimate IRFs, Unpublished doctoral dissertation, 2007) method for dichotomous item responses to the case of polytomous data. Furthermore, item parameter estimation is implemented with maximum marginal likelihood using the Bock--Aitkin EM algorithm, thereby facilitating multiple group analyses useful in operational settings. Our approach is demonstrated on both educational and psychological data. We present simulation results comparing our approach to more standard IRF estimation approaches and other non-parametric and semi-parametric alternatives.. }

A general framework for modelling responses and response times (RTs) on Likert-type personality items is presented, in which the submodel describing the item responses can be a graded item response theory model, and the submodel describing RTs is developed based on the PD hypothesis. This framework is exemplified by employing the generalized partial credit model for responses and a log-normal model for RTs. Furthermore, Bayesian methods for estimating model parameters and for assessing the model–data fit are described. A simulation study shows that the new approach improves the accuracy of estimating the individual trait levels with the ancillary information contained in RTs. Finally, the applicability of our approach is illustrated by an empirical example in personality measurements. }

In this paper we extend their basic MCMC methodology to address issues such as non-response, designed missingness, multiple raters, guessing behavior and partial credit (polytomous) test items. We apply the basic MCMC methodology to two examples from the National Assessment of Educational Progress 1992 Trial State Assessment in Reading: (a) a multiple item format (2PL, 3PL, and generalized partial credit) subtest with missing response data; and (b) a sequence of rated, dichotomous short-response items, using a new IRT model called the generalized linear logistic test model (GLLTM).}

The item step parameter of this model is decomposed to a location and a threshold parameter, following Andrich's (1978) rating scale formulation. The EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters is derived. The performance of this generalized model is compared on both simulated and real data to a Rasch family of polytomous item response models. Simulated data were generated and then analyzed by the various polytomous item response models. The results demonstrate that the rating formulation of the GPCM is quite adaptable to the analysis of polytomous item responses. The real data used in this study consisted of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (Johnson & Allen, 1992) mathematics data that used both dichotomous and polytomous items. The PCM was applied to these data using both constant and varying slope parameters. The GPCM, which provides for varying slope parameters, yielded better fit to the data than did the PCM.},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a Bayesian hierarchical approach to predict
   short-term concentrations of particle pollution in an urban environment,
   with application to inhalable particulate matter (PM10) in Greater
   London. We developed and compared several spatiotemporal models that
   differently accounted for factors affecting the spatiotemporal
   properties of particle concentrations. We considered two main source
   contributions to ambient measurements: (i) the long-range transport of
   the secondary fraction of particles, which temporal variability was
   described by a latent variable derived from rural concentrations; and
   (ii) the local primary component of particles (traffic- and
   non-traffic-related) captured by the output of the dispersion model
   ADMS-Urban, which site-specific effect was described by a Bayesian
   kriging. We also assessed the effect of spatiotemporal covariates,
   including type of site, daily temperature to describe the seasonal
   changes in chemical processes affecting local PM10 concentrations that
   are not considered in local-scale dispersion models and day of the week
   to account for time-varying emission rates not available in emissions
   inventories. The evaluation of the predictive ability of the models,
   obtained via a cross-validation approach, revealed that concentration
   estimates in urban areas benefit from combining the city-scale particle
   component and the long-range transport component with covariates that
   account for the residual spatiotemporal variation in the pollution
   process.}},

Abstract = {{P>In studies that estimate the short-term effects of air pollution on
   health, daily measurements of pollution concentrations are often
   available from a number of monitoring locations within the study area.
   However, the health data are typically only available in the form of
   daily counts for the entire area, meaning that a corresponding single
   daily measure of pollution is required. The standard approach is to
   average the observed measurements at the monitoring locations, and use
   this in a log-linear health model. However, as the pollution surface is
   spatially variable this simple summary is unlikely to be an accurate
   estimate of the average pollution concentration across the region, which
   may lead to bias in the resulting health effects. In this article, we
   propose an alternative approach that jointly models the pollution
   concentrations and their relationship with the health data using a
   Bayesian spatio-temporal model. We compare this approach with the simple
   spatial average using a simulation study, by investigating the impact of
   spatial variation, monitor placement, and measurement error in the
   pollution data. An epidemiological study from Greater London is then
   presented, which estimates the relationship between respiratory
   mortality and four different pollutants.}},

   Data for nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide

   indicator of traffic pollution, called TAP. In a previous study the
   weightings were obtained by multiple principal component analyses of the

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Downscaling is a technique that is used to extract high-resolution
   information from regional scale variables produced by coarse resolution
   models such as Chemical Transport Models (CTMs). Statistical downscaling
   methods in geophysics often rely on Empirical Orthogonal Functions
   (E0F5). EOFs are spatial Principal Components (PCs) that display
   space-time modes of variability of a quantity over a region. Here we
   present a novel statistical downscaling method that employs Fitted
   Empirical Orthogonal Functions (F-EOFs) to provide local forecasts.
   F-EOFs differ from EOFs in that they represent spacetime variations
   associated with a particular location through the use of inverse
   regression. We illustrate our downscaling method, for ozone levels over
   the US, with the Regional chEmical trAnsport Model (REAM) whose outputs
   are over 70 by 70 km grid cells. We use ground level ozone observations
   from monitoring stations within the south-eastern US region to downscale
   REAM. We select the first leading F-E0F5 and regress our observations on
   the corresponding F-EOF loadings. We also compare our results to linear
   regression and PC regression. The regression on F-EOFs shows the best
   predictive ability. To examine the consistency of our results we repeat
   the analysis for different fitting and validation periods. Furthermore,
   in our application, PFC regression also outperforms PC regression as a
   dimension reduction technique. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   We used modeled PM2.5 concentrations as pseudoobservations, because of a
   lack of PM2.5 speciated measurements over Europe, and included four
   meteorological variables. This algorithm was evaluated on the learning
   period (2000-2008) to test its ability to reproduce the pseudoobserved
   data set and then applied for two climatological scenarios (RCP4.5 and
   RCP8.5) and one historical (1975-2004) and two future periods (2020-2049
   and 2070-2099). In Italy, Poland, and northern, eastern, and
   southeastern Europe, all future scenarios lead to decreases in PM2.5,
   whereas in the Balkans, Benelux, the UK, and northern France, they lead
  to increases in PM2.5. Considering each season separately shows stronger
   responses, which may vary for a given region and scenario. Decomposing
   the changes in PM2.5 concentrations as the sum of intertype and
   intratype changes, and a residual term shows that (1) the residual term
   is negligible; (2) intertype changes affect more the regions along the
   Atlantic Ocean; and (3) in most other regions, intertype and intratype
   changes are often on the same order of magnitude. The relationship
   between the atmospheric circulation and weather types evolves and
   therefore modifies the mean of meteorological variables and PM2.5
   concentrations. This algorithm offers a novel approach to investigate
   the effect of climate change on air quality and can be applied to other
   pollutants, regions, and meteorological models. Furthermore, this
   approach can be applied using actual speciated PM2.5 observations, if a

Abstract = {{This paper shows how the advanced chemical transport model CMAQ can be
   used to estimate future levels of PM2.5 in the UK, the key air pollutant
   in terms of human health effects, but one which is largely made up from
   the formation of secondary particulate in the atmosphere. By adding the
   primary particulate contribution from typical urban roads and including
   a margin for error, it is concluded that the current indicative limit
   value for PM2.5 will largely be met in 2020 assuming 2006 meteorological
   conditions. Contributions to annual average regional PM2.5 concentration
   from wild fires in Europe in 2006 and from possible climate change
  between 2006 and 2020 are shown to be small compared with the change in
   PM2.5 concentration arising from changes in emissions between 2006 and
  2020. The contribution from emissions from major industrial sources
   regulated in the UK is estimated from additional CMAQ calculations. The
   potential source strength of these emissions is a useful indicator of
   the linearity of the response of the atmosphere to changes in emissions.
   Uncertainties in the modelling of regional and local sources are taken
   into account based on previous evaluations of the models. Future actual
   trends in emissions mean that exceedences of limit values may arise, and
   these and further research into PM2.5 health effects will need to be
   part of the future strategy to manage PM2.5 concentrations. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper describes a Bayesian hierarchical approach to predict
   short-term concentrations of particle pollution in an urban environment,
   with application to inhalable particulate matter (PM10) in Greater
   London. We developed and compared several spatiotemporal models that
   differently accounted for factors affecting the spatiotemporal
   properties of particle concentrations. We considered two main source
   contributions to ambient measurements: (i) the long-range transport of
   the secondary fraction of particles, which temporal variability was
   described by a latent variable derived from rural concentrations; and
   (ii) the local primary component of particles (traffic- and
   non-traffic-related) captured by the output of the dispersion model
   ADMS-Urban, which site-specific effect was described by a Bayesian
   kriging. We also assessed the effect of spatiotemporal covariates,
   including type of site, daily temperature to describe the seasonal
   changes in chemical processes affecting local PM10 concentrations that
   are not considered in local-scale dispersion models and day of the week
   to account for time-varying emission rates not available in emissions
   inventories. The evaluation of the predictive ability of the models,
   obtained via a cross-validation approach, revealed that concentration
   estimates in urban areas benefit from combining the city-scale particle
   component and the long-range transport component with covariates that
   account for the residual spatiotemporal variation in the pollution
   process.}},

abstract = {Summary.  Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},
